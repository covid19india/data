```

- The API is an object with keys corresponding to the two letter StateCode for each state.
- Each State object has the following keys: __districts__, __delta__, __delta7__, __meta__ and __total__. The districts object is a hash object where the keys represent individual districts in the state. The remaing three keys have the same behaviour across states and district objects. They are explained below:
- meta: This substructure provides the following details:
  - last_updated: This tells when the current state/district value was updated.
  - population: This gives the population of the state (based on NCP projections) and districts (based on 2011 census)
  - tested: This has the source and last_updated values for the testing data of the current State/District.
  - notes: This gives any special notes added at the State/District level.
- delta: This substructure contains the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases for the current day for the current State/District.
- delta7: This substructure contains the seven day moving average (7DMA) for confirmed, deceased and recovered cases calculated wrt the current day for the current State/District.
- total: This substructure contains the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases till today for the current State/District.

## Usage and Caveats

- This API has data that corresponds to the data seen on the website as of today. This includes, cumulative, delta and testing numbers across states and districts.
- The keys under __delta__, __meta__ and __total__ are present only if there is a corresponding value for the same. Example, if a specific district does not see any change in recovery numbers for today, the __recovered__ key under __delta__ for that district will not be present.
