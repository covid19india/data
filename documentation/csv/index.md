# COVID19-India API

## Announcement

We are replacing <http://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/vaccine_doses_statewise.csv> with <http://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/vaccine_doses_statewise_v2.csv> to accomdate breakup of doses adminstered of the data provided by MOFHW. We will end the support of the earlier one by July 10.

We have stopped capturing testing data at a district level. Please check the status of the API endpoints below.
## CSV

Sometimes, having files in a spreadsheet format is more useful for analysts and scientists. We have provided the files as downloadable csv files as below.

### Files available

Latest data from the google sheet (10-20 minutes delayed) is available through the `latest` end-point.
These are the files available
